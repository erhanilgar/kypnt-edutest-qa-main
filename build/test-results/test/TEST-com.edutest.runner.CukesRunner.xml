There were undefined steps. You can implement missing steps with the snippets below:

@Given("Login as a {string}")
public void login_as_a(String string) {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new cucumber.api.PendingException();
}

@When("User click {string} and {string}")
public void user_click_and(String string, String string2) {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new cucumber.api.PendingException();
}

@Then("Enter valid information and verify user created")
public void enter_valid_information_and_verify_user_created() {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new cucumber.api.PendingException();
}
